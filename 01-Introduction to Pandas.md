# Introduction
What is pandas?
Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy-to-use open source data analysis and manipulation tool built on top of the Python programming language.

It is also one of the most popular libraries used by data experts from all around the world.

# What can you do with pandas?
Pandas is used for data wrangling, data analysis and data visualisation.

Some examples include creating and merging dataframes, dropping unwanted columns and rows, locating and filling null values, grouping data by category, creating basic plots like barplot, scatter plot, histogram etc.

# Why should you learn to use pandas?
As humans interact more and more with technology, vast amounts of data are being generated each day. Hence, the ability to analyse these data and draw insights from them is becoming an increasingly important skill to have in the modern workforce. Organisations are progressively turning to data to help them better understand their customers and products, analyse past trends and patterns, improve operational efficiency and so on.

Here are just some of the many reasons why you should learn pandas:

By learning pandas, you learn the fundamental ideas behind working with data as well as some skill and knowledge to code in Python
It is straightforward to learn and you can immediately apply it to any dataset you want
It is commonly used in the data science and machine learning community
# Where can you find pandas?
Best way to get access to pandas is by installing Anaconda which is a distribution of the Python and R programming languages, both of which are heavily used in data science.

By installing Anaconda, you will also have access to Jupyter notebook which is what I am using to write up this documentation. Jupyter notebook allows you to easily run your Python code cell by cell.

# What I hope to do with this video series?
This video series is going to be a complete beginner's course on how to use pandas. I won't expect that you have any prior knowledge or background in data science or even programming in general.

Through this video series, I aim to pass on what I have learned about pandas thus far and furthermore inspire people to incorporate pandas into their future data analysis work whether that is for their university assignment, side projects or professional work.

On your end, the best way to gain value out of this video series is by doing. Programming is just like driving - you don't learn how to drive merely by reading about it or watching a video of someone else do it, you have to actually do it yourself. So I highly encourage you to install Jupyter notebook on your computer and have a go at using pandas yourself after you finish watching my weekly content.
