# Installation for Pandas
To install pandas, first you have to make the [virtual environment (venv)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). If you don't know how to install it, then [install the venv](https://github.com/marjan-ahmed/100-Days-Of-Python/Day42-Virtual%20Environment/Toturial.md) and than install the package by:
```
pip install pandas
```
```
pip install numpy
```
